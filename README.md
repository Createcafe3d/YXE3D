*Other dependancies are installed by the build scripts.

### Setup environment and build
Running _build_windows_amd64-zip.bat_ or _build_windows_x86-zip.bat_ will setup the environment and installed required components.

### Running
As YXE3D runs in a python virtual environment you first need to activate it:
_call venv/Scripts/activate.bat_
Once activated the software can be run with the command:
_python src/main.py_ 


## Mac
### Dependancies
*pip
  *If Homebrew is install this can be install via the home brew install of python which is a good idea for python development rather the using the built in: _brew install python_
*Virtual Python Environment builder
  *Install with pip install virtualenv
*Other dependancies are installed by the build scripts.

### Setup environment
Running _build_mac.sh_ will setup the environment and installed required components.

### Running
As YXE3D runs in a python virtual environment you first need to activate it:
_source venv/bin/activate_
Once activated the software can be run with the command:
_python src/main.py_ 

## Linux
### Dependancies
- amd64 platform
- darwin like linux (all testing done with ubuntu) _Other operating systems may work as well if dependancies can be met but are not yet supported_

### Setup environment
There is a handy script to help you get started:
1 Checkout the code from github _git clone https://github.com/createcafe3d/YXE3D.git_
3 Open a terminal window and go to the directory you just unziped.
4 Type  **./build_linux.sh -d -i -j** and hit enter to run 
 - The -i flag will install the requirements via apt.
 - The -j flag adds a line to allow access to the usb port. and creates a run.sh script.
 - The -d Builds a driver.


### Running
**./run.sh**  and hit enter to start the software.

#Known Issues (Includes API issues)
 - Configuration can have problems if printers are swapped while software is running
 - Virtual machines will not work as the usb driver abstractions cannot keep up
